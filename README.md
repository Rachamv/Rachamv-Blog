## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rachamv/Rachamv-Blog.git
   cd rachamv-dev-journey
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install and configure Tailwind CSS:
   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

   In your `tailwind.config.js` file, you can customize your Tailwind setup if needed.

4. Create a CSS file (e.g., `src/index.css`) and include the Tailwind directives:
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

5. Import the CSS file in your `src/index.js` or `src/main.js` file:
   ```javascript
   import './index.css';
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser. You can now start editing the components and see the changes in real time.

## Project Structure

The main component is located in `src/App.js`. Here is an example of the current structure:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <header className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-4">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">Rachamv Dev Journey</h1>
        <p className="text-xl mt-2">Sharing my experiences and insights on software development</p>
      </header>
      <main className="p-6">
        <section className="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow-md">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Welcome to My Blog!</h2>
          <p className="text-lg">
            This is a space where I document my journey in the world of software development. 
            Here, you'll find posts about various projects I'm working on, tutorials, and tips for developers.
          </p>
        </section>
      </main>
